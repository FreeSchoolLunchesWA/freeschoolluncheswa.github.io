    <h1 style="font-size:60px;">Our Manifesto</h1>
<hr style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
<h2>Preamble</h2>
<p>We're a project dedicated to getting free school lunches for Western Australian high school students year 7-12. 
    We strive to provide each and every student with a healthy lunch subsidised by the state government. Following leading policy in the EU and Scandinavia, 
    we seek to establish a comprehensive program which leaves no student uncatered for and no public school forgotten. 
    </p>
    <p>This is our manifesto as of the 22nd of October 2025.</p>

<h2>Our Goal</h2>
<p>We wish to implement the following program within the Western Australian State Government:</p>
<ul>
  <li>$600 per student per year funding for school lunches</li>
  <li>This shall cover one meal per day for a total of 200 days for every child </li>
  <li>This funding shall apply to students years 7-12 within Western Australia</li>
  <li>These lunches will be up to a health standard; e.g. there will be no junk food or premade/ ‘shop bought’ lunches. </li>
  <li>Each school is responsible for using their school canteen, etc. to provide this service however they can use recess or other times to provide a regular canteen service. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Budgeting</h2>
<p>We estimate that with 211,000 high school students and $600 per student per year that this will cost roughly $120 million per annum for the state government. </p>
<p>Looking at the most recent budget as of the writing of this manifesto: </p>
<p>There is a $2.5 billion total surplus for the 2025-26 financial year. This means that there is plenty of free capital to allocate. We propose that the state government allocates somewhere in the ballpark of $150 million of this surplus towards school lunches under the education sector of the budget. According to our calculations, this will make sure every student is covered and the overflow ensures that infrastructure is available and there are no food shortages. </p>
<p>Even with this relatively major program, the government will still yield a surplus of well over $2 billion and continue to deliver their promises in full. </p>
