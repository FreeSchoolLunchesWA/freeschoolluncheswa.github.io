<h2>Giving every high school student a good feed.</h2>
<p>We're a project dedicated to getting free school lunches for Western Australian high school students year 7-12. 
    We strive to provide each and every student with a healthy lunch subsidised by the state government. Following leading policy in the EU and Scandinavia, 
    we seek to establish a comprehensive program which leaves no student uncatered for and no public school forgotten.

<h2>How exactly will this be implemented?</h2>
<p>There are roughly 211,000 high school students in Western Australia. We aim to allocate $600 a year of funding per student to cover school lunches.
    This equates to $126.6 million in annual spending. The estimate of $600 comes from our goal to provide roughly $3 of lunch funding per student per school day for the full ~200 days of school. 
    </p>
    <p>As for the petition to parliament, we will communicate and organise with students in schools across WA to obtain the support and signatures of their classmates. The number 25,000 comes from our desire to gain the support of over 10% of WA's high school student base. 
        Without your support, we would be nowhere. 
    </p>
    <p>Recess or morning tea breaks, and primary school funding are not yet areas that are our focus. However, don't see this as set in stone as we are simply focusing on one job at a time in order to make sure our delivery is as efficient and helpful as possible. </p>
