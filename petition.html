<h2>Help us spread our petition</h2>
<p>At the moment, we are only accepting signatures from schools in order to emphasize the will of the students.
  If you are a student or teacher at a high school in WA and you want to help us get signatures, please email us the following at <a href="mailto:freeschoolluncheswa@gmail.com">freeschoolluncheswa@gmail.com</a>:
    </p>
    <ul style="width: 15%; margin-left: 42.5%;">
      <li>Your Name</li>
      <li>Your School</li>
      <li>Your Email</li>
      <li>A short spiel (1-2 sentences) of why you're helping us.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Make sure to stay in contact and we will get back to you as soon as possible. What will happen is essentially we'll make sure it's a legitimate request and that nothing sktechy is going on.
      Then, we'll send you a petition template to print out (customised to your school). We might possibly give you a signature goal and/or further instructions at the time. 
      Once all is said and done, you'll simply send us scans or decent quality photos of your signed petitions and we'll process the rest. Once we're done counting, we'll add the numbers to the website.

<h2>Help us in other ways</h2>
<p>That said, if you can't help us petition, there are always other ways you can help us! 
  Let your friends and family know, or if you're a student or teacher, let admin or school board members know about the movement. The more people know, the better! If somebody in your school is already working on the petition at your school, feel free to help them if you can!
  So don't hesistate telling anyone, because even if that person also can't contribute, they might know someone who could! 
    </p>
    <p>Thank you for your ongoing support â™¡</p>
